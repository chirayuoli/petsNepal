        <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-0 small">In the ever-growing field of information and technology, every distributed system and information is slowly getting digitized. But, the community of pet shops, keepers and enthusiasts are still lacking a unified network to interact and acquire accurate information. So, to tackle these issues and create a business as well as social relationships between the buyers and sellers, we created Pets Nepal. Pets Nepal is a web application that will not only function as a marketplace for the purchase and sales of pets like dogs, fish, birds, etc. and their necessities like food and shelter but also a go-to destination to acquire correct information about different pet-related queries through our forum. It also provides services like vaccination, breeding, and veterinary by being a bridge between the users and a collection of service providers to choose from. Being a unified marketplace, a trusted information platform, and a companion in every experience of keeping a pet is the main motto of Pets Nepal.</p>
